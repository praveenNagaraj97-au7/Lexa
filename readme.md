# New features

- This application doesn't make unnecessary api calls. The application catches the most re-occuring requests and serves the re-occured requests from store , without making a new api call! .To reduce the load balance of store the application uses queue system to store the data - by popping out old ones, when the set limit reaches .
- For the user authentication - the application makes use of ES6 generators(redux-saga) to handle the validation process by not requesting api for simple auth checks !.
- The application is designed with non - fatty action-creators , all the actions that are dispatched throughout the application are just plain object with no async logic inside them(which makes the action triggering delayed)!.
- The application is also fully-responsive , the styles for the application are manually coded with the help of sass. The app has different designs for - phones, iPad and desktops.

And also:

- The api is available in both graphQL and REST version.
- The api is documented with postman App
- The api documention can be accessed via this repo under [docs](https://github.com/praveenNagaraj97-au7/Lexa/tree/master/Docs/API) section where each endpoint is explained with examaple I/O which helps in building frontend.

  > The Restful version is deployed on google app engine and heroku.

- [Redux-form] - To handle forms data.
- [Node js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express Js] - fast node.js network app framework
- [GCP] - To store data objects / files.
- [MongoDB] - To store data of the application.
